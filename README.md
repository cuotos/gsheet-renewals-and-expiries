# GSheet Renewls and Expiries Notification

Script attached to a GSheet document do keep track of things I need to remember.

This was quick and dirty and needs some TLC. It was written a few years ago.

Config:

in Script Editor. 'file > project properties > script properties'

`destEmail` = Address to send the reminder email to  
`srcSheet`  = Link to the sheet to add in the email
